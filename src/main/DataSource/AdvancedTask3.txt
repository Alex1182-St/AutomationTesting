3. Happy Test Manager
Pre-conditions:
Your Test Manager is a good guy but unfortunately he doesn't understand how to decide whether the last build is stable for
release or it isn't. Let's imagine that he has a test_Lesson3 report with the follow data:

- passed/failed number of test_Lesson3 cases (TC)
- complete number of unresolved issues
- number of unresolved issues (bugs) with HIGH priority
- number of unresolved issues (bugs) with Blocker and Critical severity

The customer demands that every successful release has less than 20% failed TC. In addition he doesn't accept application
with more than 10 unresolved issues with HIGH priority or 5 unresolved issues with Blocker/Critical severity. His wife
throws in her two cents and insists that number of unresolved Blocker issues should be less than 5% of complete issues'
number
Challenge:
Please help your Test Manager and create a program which will read above-mentioned test_Lesson3 report data as a user input,
calculate all metrics and print build result (stable or not) to the console. In case if build isn't stable, output some additional
explanation for Test Manager.
Additional requirements:
Please realize logic for build metrics calculation and their reference values in the separate class (for ex. Metrics). User input,
comparison and the others action should be in the main class
