8. CamelCaseSeparator. Some testing frameworks can read names of test_Lesson3 methods and include them to
the report like a beautiful sentence.​ As you know, we use camelCaseNamingPolicy during writing our
tests. Please write a method which takes a test_Lesson3 name and returns beautiful sentence for report.
Example:
Input: "checkChangingProfilePicture“
Output: "Check changing profile picture"
