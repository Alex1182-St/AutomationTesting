1. A couple is going to go to the cinema. That's makes sense, if both of them have the same mood.
There are two boolean parameters heSmile and sheSmile which indicate if each is smiling or
not. Write a method which returns True if they're eventually going to go to the cinema, of False
otherwise:
visitCinema(true, true) → true
visitCinema(false, false) → true
visitCinema(true, false) → false
