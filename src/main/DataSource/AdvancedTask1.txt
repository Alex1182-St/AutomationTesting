1. Password generator. Apple ID requires a password strong enough to protect your account, data and
money. It's difficult to come up a good example of password which meets the following requirements
from Apple:
- should include uppercase and lowercase Latin letters
- should include digit (-s)
- should be at least 8 characters.
Please write a program which generates a random password considering the above-mentioned
requirements. Choose the max length of password within reasonable limits (for ex. set mas password's
length = 15)
